# Next Storefront

A simple storefront built with Next.js and GraphQL. Acts as an ongoing learning project for myself.

## Running the project

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Development

```shell
pnpm dev
```

### Production

```shell
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Future improvements

- Add tests
- GraphQL Codegen
- Error handling
- Product status (e.g. out of stock, on sale, etc.)
- Use half stars for ratings
- Render the product description as HTML
- Enlarge product image on hover / click
- Gallery for product images
- Add navigation (primary and secondary, as in breadcrumbs etc...)
